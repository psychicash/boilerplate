Project Manager

This program is there to help speed up the template process.

Function:

This program lets you, with a click of a button, copy a template
from your template library to your working project library.

How?

First, you have to create a template.  Place your Template in the boilerplates
directory in the manager folder.  Included in the manager directory is a file
"template_info.json".  This file must be in the template folder.

Feel free to fill it out as the info will be copied and used for the new
projects.

Once you've completed this step, run the program.

Type in the name of your project, I suggest keeping it simple.

Click on the folder and select your project directory.

If you go under file/settings, you can put in your name or the name you
want the project to be credited to.

This info will save along with your project dir preference, between 
uses.

The Project name can be anything at all.  The name is the basis for the 
project's directory name so it should be a valid directory name.

click on projects folder and click open directory.

The project manager (no karen you can't speak with him)
will make a directory under your projects name and 
copy the template to it.
